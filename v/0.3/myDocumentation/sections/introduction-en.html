<p> Information about building materials is one of the important aspects to manage a building
holistically and in a sustainable way over all phases of its building life cycle. The assignment of
material specifications to building elements and sharing these details between stakeholders involved
in a project is a decisive task. It will influence the project largely. These properties associated
with different layers of building elements are necessary to perform energy, acoustic, lighting,
etc. simulations at different stages of the project. Development and analysis of engineering models
of a building from its early stages onwards enable performance evaluations and support informed
design choices and decisions based on optimization. Seamless data transfer from the BIM model to
analytical models considerably increases the efficiency and reduces the inconsistencies, efforts,
and time in collaboration scenarios. However, challenges in data sharing activities are persistent
in the current workflow for the conversion of BIM models to analytical models. Hence, the DICBM
ontology was developed to represent construction and material models of building elements and to
improve interoperability. The concepts considered in the DICBM ontology are represented in the
figure below.</p>
